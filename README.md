PowerOfMath ‚Äî Serverless Calculator

üöÄ Personal Project Showcase by Rithvik
Demonstrates full AWS serverless architecture using Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Amplify.

üìå Project Overview

PowerOfMath is a personal project where I built a serverless web application to compute base^exponent and store results in AWS DynamoDB. This project demonstrates full AWS integration with a frontend, backend, API, and secure data storage.

Frontend: HTML page hosted via AWS Amplify

Backend: AWS Lambda function that calculates powers and logs results in DynamoDB

API: Exposed via API Gateway POST endpoint with CORS enabled

Security: IAM role with least-privilege permissions for DynamoDB access

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Component	AWS Service / Tech
Hosting	AWS Amplify
Serverless Logic	AWS Lambda
API	API Gateway (POST endpoint)
Database	DynamoDB
Security	IAM Roles & Policies
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
üí° Features

Computes powers of numbers (base^exponent)

Stores all results with timestamp in DynamoDB

Fully web-accessible via Amplify-hosted frontend

Secure and restricted DynamoDB access via IAM policy

Extendable for calculation history or analytics

üöÄ Deployment Instructions
